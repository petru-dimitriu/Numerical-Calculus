# Least Squares Circle
MATLAB program which computes the least squares circle fit, for a given data set, which is read as a 2-column vector containing points. In simple terms, the least squares circle fit is the circle which passes through or besides a set of points as closely as possible, according to the least squares approximation.

The program shows reads the data, displays the centre and the radius of the least squares circle, and plots the circle along with the data points.
